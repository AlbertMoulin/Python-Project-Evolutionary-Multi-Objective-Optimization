Implemented the NSGAII algorithm on m-LOTZ functions.
To test the NSGAII algorithm you can modify the main function of the NSGA.py file. 
If you want to test the unmodified version of the algorithm you can always comment the line which recalculates the crowding distances in the function extract max of the Binary Heap.
